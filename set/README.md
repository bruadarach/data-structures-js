# Set

- A Set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values.
- However, the values must be unique.

<br>

- Set can contain a mix of different data types.
- You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same set.

<br>

- Sets are dynamically sized.
- You donâ€™t have to declare the size of a set before creating it.

<br>

- Sets do not maintain an insertion order. (= No order)

<br>

- Sets are iterables.
- They can be used with a for of loop
